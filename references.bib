  abstract  = "One of the decision problems in many organizations and
               institutions is to decide how to schedule different tasks, in
               particular, in higher education institutions. One of the main
               problems is the university course timetabling problem (UCTP):
               this problem consists of the allocation of events (courses,
               professors, and students) to a number of fixed time slots and
               rooms, this at the beginning of each academic period of the
               universities. The existent formulations include particular
               requirements from different educational levels and institutions,
               as in our case. In this paper, we focus on the university course
               timetabling problem with the assignment of professor-course-time
               slot for an institution in Mexico. Timetabling is constructed
               for the disciplinary courses that are offered by one of the
               academic departments. The main characteristics are as follows:
               (1) there are full-time and part-time professors; (2) a
               mandatory fixed number of courses has to be assigned to each
               full-time professor according to their academic profile; (3)
               there is a maximum number of courses assigned to part-time
               professors; (4) a professor-course matrix that specifies the
               valid assignation is defined; and (5) mandatory time periods for
               courses in different semesters are established and other
               traditional constraints. We present the integer linear
               programming model proposed to solve the case studied. The
               optimal solution was obtained with low computational effort
               through the classical branch-and-bound algorithm. We describe
               the complete timetable to show the model effectiveness.",

  abstract  = "One of the most challenging tasks performed by the department
               chair every semester is the assignment of faculty members to
               courses. This task, when done manually, is tedious to accomplish
               because of the numerous faculty-course combinations, the
               policies to be considered, faculty retirements, faculty
               resignations, and the hiring of faculty members. Satisfying the
               needs of employees has been increasingly significant in the
               scheduling decisions of different companies. In this study, a
               binary integer programming model that considers the preferences
               of faculty members was proposed to solve the faculty-course
               allocation problem. Constraints that permit the faculty members
               to perform other duties aside from instruction were included in
               the model. The model was applied to the faculty-course
               assignment of a department. Schedules that considered both
               policies in educational institutions and the preferences of
               faculty members were obtained.",

abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-swarm particle swarm optimization (MSPSO) that consists of three novel strategies to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. The new proposed MSPSO in this work is based on multiple swarms framework cooperating with the dynamic sub-swarm number strategy (DNS), sub-swarm regrouping strategy (SRS), and purposeful detecting strategy (PDS). Firstly, the DNS divides the entire population into many sub-swarms in the early stage and periodically reduces the number of sub-swarms (i.e., increase the size of each sub-swarm) along with the evolutionary process. This is helpful for balancing the exploration ability early and the exploitation ability late, respectively. Secondly, in each DNS period with special number of sub-swarms, the SRS is to regroup these sub-swarms based on the stagnancy information of the global best position. This is helpful for diffusing and sharing the search information among different sub-swarms to enhance the exploitation ability. Thirdly, the PDS is relying on some historical information of the search process to detect whether the population has been trapped into a potential local optimum, so as to help the population jump out of the current local optimum for better exploration ability. The comparisons among MSPSO and other 13 peer algorithms on the CEC2013 test suite and 4 real applications suggest that MSPSO is a very reliable and highly competitive optimization algorithm for solving different types of functions. Furthermore, the extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the three proposed strategies used in MSPSO.}
