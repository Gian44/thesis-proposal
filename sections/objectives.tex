\section{Objectives of the Study}
\label{sec:objectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
\label{subsec:generalobjective}

To design and develop a Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (MSPSO) algorithm to solve the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP).

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\label{subsec:specificobjectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop and analyze the MSPSO algorithmic usage and efficacy in solving UCTP. 
    \item To model the UCTP with crucial characteristics like room availability, course prerequisites, and faculty courses within the framework of MSPSO. 
    \item To perform a state-of-the-art analysis by comparing with other existing approaches to solve the UCTP
\end{enumerate}
